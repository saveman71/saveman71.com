This is my personal website. Here I will occasionally post my findings, tips and tricks and more generally share my perspectives regarding the software I build and use within my freelance activities and others.

I'm currently working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer and available for hire.

I'm currently located in Paris, France but I usually work fully remote.

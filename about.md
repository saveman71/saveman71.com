This is my personal website. Here I will occasionally post my findings, tips and tricks and more generally share my perspectives regarding the software I build and use within my freelance activities and others.

I'm currently a Lead Software Engineer at [La Belle Assiette](https://labelleassiette.fr), a private chef company that edits its own premium booking website (think AirBnB for private chefs).

I'm currently located in Paris, France.
